Steps to execute:
There are 2 components in this zipped archive.
1. Docker
To run Docker tests, 'cd' into the Docker folder and run the script 'project1.sh' from cmd.

2. RMI Library
To test the RMI library, either replace the conformance folder with your own version of
conformance and run 'make test' from the root of the project, or use the existing copy of conformance.

Results from our end:
1. All 4/4 tests pass for Docker.

2. RMI Library was tested locally on Linux, Mac machine and on Docker environment. 

    a. All 23/23 tests pass on local linux machine. On Mac machine, it passes almost
    always, with 1 occasional timeout, which is quite rare. In case that rare occasion must occur,
    please re-run make test, and it would surely pass with all 23/23 tests.

    b. All 23/23 tests pass in the Docker environment with separate client and server containers.

We stress-tested the RMI tests for a 1000 times. On Linux machines all 1000 tests passed.
